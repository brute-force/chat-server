# chat-server
Are you tired of your friends never looking at the videos you send them in chat? Do they say "I'll look later!" or "I'll bookmark this?" And then when you talk about the videos you can tell they've never seen them? Or have they just started saying "I'm never clicking this?"  
  
Here's a chat server that parses YouTube links and automatically plays the videos right on their chat page! Now they'll have to watch your videos -- at least until they close the browser tab.
